# Secure Auth0 Setup for Persimmon Intelligence

## Security Explanation

You're absolutely right to be concerned about exposing credentials! Here's what's secure and what's not:

### ✅ What's Safe to Expose (Public)
- **Auth0 Client ID**: This is designed to be public and can safely appear in client-side code
- **Auth0 Domain**: This is also public information

### ❌ What Must Stay Secret (Private) 
- **Auth0 Client Secret**: Never expose this! (We don't use it in SPAs anyway)
- **API Keys and Tokens**: Never in client-side code

## Secure Implementation

I've updated your setup to use Netlify's environment variables, which inject values at **build time** rather than exposing them in source code.

### How It Works

1. **Environment Variables**: Set in Netlify dashboard (private)
2. **Build Process**: Values injected during deployment (secure)
3. **Client Code**: Contains actual values, but source code doesn't (secure)

### Setup Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables in Netlify**:
   ```
   VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-actual-domain.auth0.com
   VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-client-id
   VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-api-audience (optional)
   ```

2. **In Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Go to Site Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add the variables above with your actual Auth0 values

3. **Deploy**: The build script will inject these values securely

### Files Updated

- `build.sh`: New build script that handles secure injection
- `netlify.toml`: Updated to use the build script
- `auth.js`: Updated to read from environment config
- `login-secure.html`: Example with build-time injection

### Why This Is Secure

1. **Source Code**: No credentials in your GitHub repository
2. **Build Time**: Values only added during Netlify deployment
3. **Environment**: Sensitive values stored securely in Netlify
4. **Client Side**: Final code has values, but they're public anyway

### Testing Locally

For local development, create a `.env` file (add to `.gitignore`):
```
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-domain.auth0.com
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
```

This approach follows security best practices for SPAs with Auth0!
